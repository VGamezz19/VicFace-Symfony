Installation
------------

PHP >= 5.5.9 required

## Installing Composer

Composer is the dependency manager used by modern PHP applications and it can also be used to create new applications.

Download the installer from [getcomposer.org/download](https://getcomposer.org/download/), execute it and follow the instructions.

## Creating a new project with Composer

  ```
  php composer.phar create-project itrascastro/symfony-3-base-project my_project_name
  ```

If you did a global install and do not have the composer.phar in that directory run this instead:

  ```
  composer create-project itrascastro/symfony-3-base-project my_project_name
  ```
